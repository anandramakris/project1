    "The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):\n",

    "Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Michigan is one of twenty states which administer the SAT to high school juniors for free ([*source*](https://blog.prepscholar.com/which-states-require-the-sat)). It is one of three states, the other two being Connecticut and Delaware, which had a 100% SAT participation rate during 2017, 2018, and 2019. Of the three, Michigan is the largest by population ([*source*](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states)) and also has the most universities with 85 ([*source*](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-state-has-the-most-colleges.html)). State law requires SAT scores to be put on student transcripts since it is part of the Michigan Merit Exam ([*source*](https://detroit.chalkbeat.org/2021/6/25/22549509/michigan-sat-university-college)). While many Michigan colleges have decided on test-optional application requirements, college counselors in the state have said that \"students are better off taking the SAT or the ACT, if they can\" ([*source*](https://www.bridgemi.com/talent-education/will-coronavirus-curb-act-and-sat-admissions-tests-michigan-colleges))."

    "Of the ten Michigan colleges for which accepted SAT data has been revealed, seven of them have 25th percentile SAT scores higher than the average SAT score in Michigan during 2017 (1005). What is surprising is that two of those seven, Kalamazoo College and Hope College, have acceptance rates higher than 75%, indicating that the people who apply to them generally have higher SAT scores than the average Michigander. Kalamazoo and Hope are both small, with Kalamazoo having a student body of 1451 ([*source*](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/kalamazoo-college-2275)) and Hope having an enrollment of 3061 ([*source*](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/hope-college-2273)). So it might be that those who wish to attend small colleges have higher SAT scores."

    "You should certainly do better than the average Michigander on the SAT to get into **any** of the ten Michigan colleges. If you perform at the average level from 2017 to 2019, you might barely get into Albion, Central Michigan, or Eastern Michigan and you will not get into the others at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there is a strong negative correlation between acceptance rate and SAT scores, you should try the hardest for the two highly selective colleges, the University of Michigan and Hillsdale College. Try for a perfect score if your first choice is the University of Michigan and at least 1500 if your first choice is Hillsdale so you will not lose much if you fall short. If your first choice is any of the other eight, aim for 1300, even if the admission rate makes you feel more confident about getting in while doing worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is debatable whether you should the SAT at all, given how learning at home, especially without the proper resources, leads to students becoming far behind. But given Michigan's unique situation of requiring SAT scores on transcripts, it is worth the effort to do well because college admissions teams will look at the score."
